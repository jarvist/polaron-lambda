Scripts to generate the 4-Gaussian jobs from an input molecule to calculate the
'inner sphere' reorganisation energy.

This is useful as an input into the Marcus equation for electron / hole
transport in organic semiconducting materials.

These calculations are pretty trivial and can be created by hand, but I wrote
these scripts to allow the automatic calculation of many different lambdas (in
particular, when seeing whether you could vary lambda by chemical design to
induce better charge transport).

The scripts are very hairy.
